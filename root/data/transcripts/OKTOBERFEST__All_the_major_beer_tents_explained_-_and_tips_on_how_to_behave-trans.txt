There are 14 big turns on the October Fest, excluding the Oedivisen. And I will introduce them all to you. Generally speaking, you can say that every October Fest beer is good. There are personal preferences. Some beers are more hoppy, others are sweeter, but all are very very drinkable. And basically the best place, the best table is the one you are sitting at, especially on very busy days at the October Fest. But if you have the choice, there are more nuances between the tents. And I explain them all from the north to the south. The first tent is the Marshtal. It is reminiscent of the tradition when they used to be horse races at the October Fest. Today, the Marshtal is the meeting point for all kinds of celebrities. Absolute a-list celebrities like Anoschwatzneger, then there are celebrities that are known only in Germany, and celebrities that nobody knows. The Champagne bar is also an education that the venue is aimed at an upmarket audience. And before I forget it, you will find all the links to the tents in the description. The Fischerfohni is located directly opposite. As the name suggests, everything here revolves around fish. And anyone who likes fish should definitely try a Stacalfish, a fish grilled on a stick. The Fischerfohni serves Augustina, that's always beer from a wooden barrel. I will go into more detail about this in the Augustina tent. The Fischerfohni is also very popular in the LGBTQ scene. The so-called Prosecco Reason always takes place there on the second Monday of October Fest. There are certain events specifically for LGBTQ scene at the October Fest. However, the following applies to the October Fest and every tent. Whether gay, lesbian or otherwise queer, everyone is welcome, even non-drinkers. The Ambrostrzitsn set, Crossbow Tent, is reminiscent of another tradition. In the past shooting championships were held on the Terazian visa. These were integrated into the October Fest. Even today, the German Crossbow Championships are held on a shooting range in the tent. Unfortunately, the shooting range is not open to the public. And a word about the production, I started filming around 10am on a weekday, so that I could get into all the tents. You see, the tents get full and full in this video. So if you don't have a reservation, you should try to get a place at the stage between 10 and 11am. Then of course, you should drink tactically, so that you can still enjoy the party in the evening. The next tent is the Oksumbratarei. The name says it all, our whole Oks is roasted here, or 100 over the entire 16 days of the October Fest. Today, the Oks Alois is roasting, an animal weighing 900 kg or 2000 American Pounds. A roast Oks with red wine sauce and potato salad cost 24 euro 90 cent. But you can also order the Oksfilet, which cost 45 euro and 50 cent, as the saying goes, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. The largest October Fest tent is the Hofbrachaus tent. When many other tents have already closed due to overcrowding, the Hofbrachaus tent is sometimes still open. This is also because it's the only tent with bar tables. Many tourists end up here, playing drinking games with funnels and houses. A Munich resident would never do that, because you don't play with food. Of course, the Hofbrachaus mascot Alois is also present, but they'll have to tell the legend of the drinking male man another time. The Hacquat tent shines with a beautiful panorama of the city of Munich. It has become one of the most popular tents and is therefore often the first to close due to overcrowding. It is advertised as the heaven of the Bevarian. When you see the interior, you know why. And it has become more and more popular among young people. The Agustina tent on the other hand is more for traditionalists. And when I say that, you have to take it with a grain of salt. The band in the Agustina plays many Bevarian classics and polkas. Towards the evening, however, it picks up just as much with party hits. And bands in so-called party tents also tend to play Bevarian classics at lunchtime. But was distinguishes Agustina tents from all the other tents? Wouldn't 200 liter barat's? Hirschen are still tapped here. While other tents all you steal containers for their beer. The barat you see in other tents are just decoration. And because I keep talking about how to get into a tent, the beer garden in front of the tents is a great alternative, especially when the weather is nice. And sometimes it's even the better solution if you don't feel like parting or if you just want to have lunch with the family. The next tent is arguably the most important one. Why is it the most important one? Because here the first barrel is tapped by the mayor of Munich. And did I tell you to subscribe that I would be there next year? Well, anyway, the Schottenhamel has its name from the family Schottenhamel. But since Schottem means Scotsman in German and Hamel means Mutton, there's a Mutton with a flat head as emblem. What the hell was that? They've gone to plan! The Schottenhamel is also important because in 1872, the landlord ran out of normal summer beer and had to serve the stronger mayor's and beer as a result. After initial protest, it became today's October Fest beer. And another little anecdote. In 1908, the Schottenhamel became the first electrified October Fest tent. Back then, a 17-year-old Albert Einstein had with the wiring. Today, the Schottenhamel is considered a party tent and is still popular among young people. And that's the corner where I had wild October Fest parties in my younger years. And speaking of me, of course I went to the October Fest in my typical Munich track, a stoderad doctor Dracht, a city dweller doesn't wear a traditional costume. Next up is the Breurusel. The Breurusel is once again a fixed meeting point for the AG BTQ scene. I was here on Ruezel Montag the day after gay Sunday and maybe that's why the rainbow flag was hanging here or maybe it always hangs here. Correct me in the comments. But whether you're gay or not, everyone is welcome at the Breurusel and the beautiful covered outdoor balcony invites you to stay in on warm autumn evenings. The Polarna tent is very close by. In addition to cold Polarna October Fest beer, it also serves Germany's most popular soft drink. Polarna Spitzi. I told you non beer drinkers are also welcome at the October Fest. Of course they also have a warm kitchen like all festival tents. Opposite the Polarna tent is the Lüvenboy tent. It was my favorite tent as a child, not because I spent even a minute in it, but because of that. It's not my tent today either, but apparently the tent is very popular with many Italians and they create a good atmosphere. And because the tent was the first to switch to LED, it has won many environmental awards. Next to the Bavaria statue, you will find their Schützenfestzeit, the tent for the marksman. This tent refers to the tradition of marksmen as well. There's also a shooting range here. Apparently you can actually shoot an air rifle and air pistol here, but only if you haven't drunk any alcohol beforehand. Alcohol and weapons are not a good combination. Anyone who knows more about this should leave a comment. And if you're wondering why the tent is so beautiful decorated, it doesn't always look quite so nice. The day I was filming was Regina's sixth ladies day, the owner of the sixth car rental company. Once a year she invites successful women from all fields to the October Fest. In recent years the Schützenfestzeit has become a popular partitent, and I know many people whose favorite tent it is. If you don't like beer but prefer wine, Kuflas wine tent might be something for you. Wine has been available at the October Fest for a long time. The atmosphere is a little bit more dignified to match the drink, but by no means bad. As the wine tent doesn't close at 11 pm, like the beer tents, but only at 1 am, it is the place to go for many who want to continue partying. However, the bounces are strict. If you are too drunk, you have no chance of getting in. And the last tent is the Kifat tent. This is where the who is who of Munich meets and after Bayern celebrates here once a year. More exuberant after victories, only mineral water is served after defeats. It's the only tent where I wasn't able to take any photos inside, because it was already closed due to overcrowding. But I'm not part of the chic society and I have no business being there. So these were all the big tents at the October Fest, but before I leave you, I give you a few tips on how to behave. If you are in a tent and it's closed, don't leave the tent. You won't be able to get back. Use the toilets in the tent. Because what is the excuse security here most often? I have to go into the tent, there are all my friends. Even if it's true, nobody will believe you. Second advice. Don't get on the tables. You are only allowed to stand on the benches. You will be kicked out sooner than you think. Third advice. Don't steal the glasses. They will catch you and you will have to pay a hefty fine. Fourth advice. Never ever sit or lay on the cot's eagle, the pukele. It's a little hill behind the tents. I took these pictures on the first day and maybe it is still acceptable to sit there. But in the evening, this hill is soaked with all bodily fluids you can imagine, vomit, wide yellow red and brown fluids. This is the hill of shame. Avoid it. Fifth and last advice. The October Fest with its six to seven million visitors is a relatively safe festival. However, when so many people come together under the influence of alcohol, they are naturally also problems. If you get into trouble, go behind the shot and hummlet tent. There you will find the October Fest police and paramedics if you are injured. And for the ladies, in recent years, the City of Munich has done a lot to increase the safety of women as well. You will also find awareness teams there if you feel harassed.
