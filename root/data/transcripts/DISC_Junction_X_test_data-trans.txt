This evening, I cleaned up the kitchen and turned on the TV to listen to the news. Recent news have discussed workplace pressures on women and the division of labor in the home. This news made me recalled what I heard a few days ago while watching short videos. I saw someone say, women should stay home to take care of the children. And earning money is a man's job. This statement really bothered me. I hope everyone can understand that the division of labor in the family is a choice, not a criterion for judging someone. Some people choose to back quote, back quote work, and some choose to take care of the children. As long as they support each other, that's fine. Yesterday at the market. I came across a scene that particularly annoy me. Someone saw a disabled customer buying groceries and started muttering, saying people with disabilities shouldn't be out. Making others wait and disrupting their shopping. I was upset, how could anyone harbor such bias? At that moment, I thought to myself. This kind of discriminatory thinking is simply another form of hate speech. I kept thinking about it on the way home. Many of the seemingly casual online comments and street talk we see reflect underlying attitudes and prejudices. I hope that in the future, whether in society or online. We can all be more tolerant and less biased towards one another.
