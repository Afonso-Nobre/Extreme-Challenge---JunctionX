Hello! I'm back! I'm back in San Francisco. As you may know, I have been traveling for the last 10 weeks. So that's why I have not added more podcasts to the Effortless English podcast. I've been traveling in Thailand and Singapore and Cambodia. And I did a big seminar, an Effortless English seminar in Bangkok, and it was fantastic. It was amazing. But unfortunately, I was very busy while traveling, and I just didn't have time or fast internet connections to add more podcasts. But now I just got back to San Francisco. I just got back home. So now I will be adding more podcasts again. And this is the first one. So back in San Francisco, look forward to more podcasts from Effortless English coming soon. This is AJ Hogue. See you soon. Bye-bye. Oh, and one more thing. Our new video, Master Membersite, is almost ready for testing. In fact, we will probably start testing with a few of our All-Star members next week. This is a very, very exciting project. So this site will be a member site. So members will join you pay a monthly subscription. Not so much. It will be less than $25 a month, not so much. Quite cheap. We're keeping it cheaper. And you'll sign up. You'll subscribe to the video site. You'll get a username and a password. And then you can watch videos of me with text. So again, you can get a lot more English input. And you'll also be able to read everything. So you can use a dictionary if you need to. So this will be a very exciting fun site with I'll add little extra lessons and lots of fun video. So coming soon, our Master Member Video site. And next week, we will begin testing it with just a few of our special top members. I'll keep giving you more information about the video site as we test it. And I will tell you when it's ready for everybody. Very, very exciting. Keep coming back and listening for updates about our new subscription member video site, the Master Member Video site. Coming soon. Bye bye.
