Please welcome Margot Robbie, a great actor. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I do like it. Yeah, I do like it. I do like it. Waited my entire life to say this, but hi, Barbie. Hi, Barbie. Hi, Barbie. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Oh, yeah, of course. Margot, we saw you arrive pulling a pink suitcase, and the Barbie look has really... I'm leaning in. You're leaning in. Yeah. Margot, end, and Barbie begin. I don't even know anymore. It's just a pink fever dream at this point. I never thought I'd own so many pink things in my life. But yeah, like I said, I'm leaning in, and I'm loving it. It's fun. Have you had kids coming up, recognising you as Barbie first? Uh, oh, do you know what? Today, when we were at icebergs, we were walking down to get a photo, and I heard a dad say to the wee little girl, he's like, that's Barbie. And she went, and I was like, oh, it was really cute. It's really real. Yay! Greta, I came to this movie thinking it was a movie about dolls, but it's not. Is it? Well, it's... It is, in a way, it's about... I mean, it's about Barbie, but it's also about human beings, and we're the people that make dolls, and then love the dolls, and then get mad at the dolls, and then make the dolls different than they are. But yeah, it's really about people. Who's a fool? Who's a movie fool? It's for everybody. I don't know. It's for everyone. It's really interesting. Warner didn't tell us to say that. We genuinely wanted to make something that everyone would just have a great time watching, and I think we did. Yeah. We all did. We were allowed to watch half an hour of it, so I don't know the answer. What do you think? I loved it. Absolutely. When it's done, but we wanted more, yeah. We want to leave it wanting more. I do have a question. Is Barbie a feminist? Sure. Yeah, yeah. Totally. Well, I actually think she's something a little more than feminist, because at the beginning, the power dynamic is definitely in the barbie's favor. Yes. So if you're talking about equality between men and women, it's actually not quite equal in Barbie learn to begin with. But there is a power dynamic shift at some point. Can you name some support? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, the barbie is a kind of... I think it's just like, I am woman here in me, Rob. Yeah. Would they finally get the chance to have that? Yeah. Let's go back to the start, then. Who called who about this movie? She. I called Greta. And where was the idea? How do you always thought that would be fun? Or how did it come about? Like a Barbie movie. Like a Barbie movie. I thought it would be really exciting and really scary, because, you know, there's a lot of ways to do it wrong, but if you did it right, it could be huge. And it's, I think Greta did it right. And there was very few people I'd want to do this with. And Greta was the top of the list. And kind of like if she said, no, I just don't know what I'm saying. Did you have hesitation, though? Because there's this complex history of Barbie, right? Right. Well, I mean, I didn't have any hesitation. I knew I wanted to work with Margot, and we'd met before, and we'd wanted to do something. And then when she brought this to me, it was terrifying, of course, because people do have so many feelings about it, and it is such an icon, but it's an icon that's meant so many different things at different moments. But I could feel myself leaning into it, like, and being kind of curious about it, and also feeling scared, which is usually when there's something good about it. Speaking about leaning in, I could not get my face closer to my phone screen when every single trailer has come out for this movie. There is a particular moment you know where you're in, you hear the music, you take a step out, and that just absolutely had me on the floor. I need to know everything. Is it you? Is it special effects? Did you get a special pedicure? What on earth is happening? Okay, let me go through those questions. Yes, it is to me. No, it's no special effects. You'd be amazed how few VFX there are in this film, actually. I don't know. We didn't do that many takes of it. A couple of takes, and I kind of held on to like a bar, so I was steady once I stepped. We just put double-sided tape on the floor so that my shoes would stay still. I did have a pedicure that morning. She does have it. There was a big discussion at the beginning where they were, they were, they, everyone said, are you gonna CGI all the feet? And I thought, oh, God, that's terrifying. No, that's so nice. And so, and I was like, and she has the nicest feet. Oh, she's perfect. She does. It's a tough one. No, she does. She has these beautiful, beautiful dancer feasts and I was like, should I just hang on to that bar and do it just like that? What's it kind of finding all those kind of iconic motifs and throwbacks to Barbie, you know, and just reinventing them now? Definitely. I mean, even like, I mean, that, that in particular, the feet felt like a, like, a bit of a bat signal in a way. And so did the work. So did the, so did the B of Barbe. Like, there were just like things where it was suddenly like, it's like, we realize globally, it's known, but also we kind of all share this collective memory of what Barbie means. And it was, even though it's this huge movie, it feels really personal to me. Like, it feels like something we made together and that it was made by somebody people cared about it so much. And even like, the, the Barbie logo that we used is the logo that I had because that was like, I was a child of the 80s and I would stand in the toy store and all the boxes that were so, I mean, I was like, the wide boxes, because it meant their hair was really big. And the hair was like, fanned out. And I was like, I don't know. I just wanted the one that I liked, you know? It does mean so much to so many people. But in the, I'm not sure if Margot filled you in on this greater, but the word Barbie means something else in Australia. Did you brief Greta? Where is it made here? Like a barbecue. Like a barbecue. Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! We've lost them. Oh, no. What have you done to our age? I'm so Barbie now, I've had it. You know, a Barbie, yeah. A Barbie, yeah. Having a Barbie. So that's what we call like a barbecue. So you weren't aware of that? Not as such. I thought you mean the jet lag by the way. Don't blame the blonde hair blame the jet lag. No, I mean, I had to hurt, yeah, but Barbie. Yeah, but a Barbie. Yeah. I thought maybe there could be like a promotional crossover, like, you know, Barbie. I'm deeply regretting that there's not now, but you mention it. We're gonna waste a few minutes. Yeah. Barbie, Barbie, on there doing some snacks. Oh, I'm really annoyed we didn't do anything like this. We're gonna make you grill after this. Yeah. We'll fit it into Mark's house. Really weird idea about a game called Barbie or Barbie. Yeah, so they wouldn't let him do it. And now I'm really glad. All week I was pitching it. We're in a disaster. I was gonna name barbecue items and then things from the Barbie universe and you had to guess. But can you imagine, Barbie, that would have gone if you don't even know what a Barbie is. That's your idea. I'm not gonna be the idea. I'm gonna stop. So the amazing thing is that Barbie can do everything. Yeah. Can we have an experiment with Newsreader Barbie and get you to read the last headline that we didn't quite get to? Would you be happy to shoot? I'm, yes. Okay, so which camera do we want? We want camera four over there. Let me get out of shot. Let me get out of shot. Barbie there. Okay, camera four. Camera four. Two, one. Cute. Two more news now. And could Barbie Mania be leading to a Barbie baby name boom? One expert from the US says we could be at the start of a Barbara comeback after the name dominated charts from the 1920s to the 50s. She has a long way to climb Barbara currently sitting at number 1372. While Ken is at a 178. Other names from Barbie land like Mitch seem less likely to make a comeback. Poor Mitch. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Perfect news reading. It's a fun reading off the table. Yeah, actually it's quite fun. Do you like my news? I was worried. You're so much better than the rest of us. Making up which, so I have a feeling right that you're a bit sporty. You're not just, you know, just mega. So is she actually sporty? So my superpower is guessing what netball position you would have played. But just, yeah, netball, Barbie. But first, I need to find out, like, did you ever play netball? I didn't. I played hockey. We can't be friends. No, no. Sorry. Are they similar positions in hockey? Well, no, not really. No. I have done my research and I feel like in netball, if you're a, if stereotypical Barbie was a netball player, she'd be a goal attack right. But I feel, and so in hockey, she'd probably be a striker. But I feel like Margot Robbie is a bit naughty. Am I right? Yeah, I was never sent to forward or anything like that. No, you would have been in defence, wouldn't you? And I was on the wing. I was off to the fence. I was off to the fence. Actually, I was the one that would bring in if they needed to really whack the ball. So you were a netball player with weapons. I need a weapon. Yeah, we can be friends, actually. So you would have been a winged defence for a goal defence in netball. Oh, great. Yeah, Greta, I'm feeling like you've got goalkeeper vibes, which is my position, because obviously we can be friends. Or you would be the coach. You would be the skin charge of a soul. Would she be the coach, Maggie? Yeah. Well, I don't know, actually. Well, she could be the goal attack. Is that what you call the attack running the play? Yeah. I don't know. She's got a lot of fire. Greta did any of that, I think. Yeah, you guys are, that don't know what you're saying. So Margot's just handed you the most coveted position on the netball player. Yeah. I'm sticking Margot up the back with me, because I'm a goalkeeper with no mates. I was so happy with you. I was really good at cheering, so I'll just be on the side, just hyping you up. That was actually the net, because it was fantastic. So this is this trick on us earlier, and I got told I was on the bench. Yeah, they did. Yeah, they did. We're getting out of the bench with Margot Robbie starting to go quite severe. That's really fun. That works. Barbies and cinnamon is everywhere from the 20th of July. I think we're all keen to go see it. Please thank Greta Goe, and Margot Robbie for joining us. Thank you. Thank you.
