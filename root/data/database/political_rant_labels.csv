"I swear to God, the Republicans who are trying to impose a Christian nationalist theocracy on all of us would be some of the first people thrown into the gulags that they want to build because as much as they say they hate gay and trans people, they somehow always end up inadvertently revealing how much they love gay and trans people when nobody else is looking if you're picking up what I'm putting down.",2
"For those not keeping track, there's Bridget Ziegler, the co-founder of the notoriously anti-LGBTQ organization Moms for Liberty, who was having sex with women.",2
"There's Matt Schlapp, the chair of CPAC who was accused of groping multiple men, in fact he settled with one accuser for nearly half a million dollars.",2
"There's Randy McNally, Tennessee's lieutenant governor who voted in favor of anti-gay policies despite leaving heart and fire emojis in the comment section of an Instagram Twink's thirst traps.",2
"There's Jesse Lee Peterson, the anti-gay radio host and pastor who forgot to log out of his main Twitter account before liking gay porn and by gay porn I mean the gayest porn imaginable.",1
"Like we're talking men eating each other's asses, gay.",1
"There's also Alex Jones who's been transvestigating former First Lady Michelle Obama for years, he forgot to close the tab that he had opened with trans porn before filming a wellness segment for his show Info Wars.",2
"There's Ethan Schmidt, Carrie Lake, Ally and right wing provocateur who threatened to hunt LGBTQ supporters, only to get busted hunting for cock on Grindr, specifically one that would be smacked across his big dumb face.",1
"Then there's Stephen Crowder, an anti-LGBTQ conservative podcaster who was a little too comfortable in drag who was accused of sexual harassment by his former staffers, one in particular Owen Benjamin bemoaned how Crowder would force them all to wear really degrading and sexualizing outfits and asked how was dressing like degenerate fruit cakes owning the left.",1
"On top of that, Crowder once admitted that he was worried that his former bisexual phase would come back in a segment where he was vocalizing his fears about himself.",1
"I'm sorry, but if one of your current fears is that your former bisexual phase will come back, it's not a phase.",1
"Like by your 30s, you should have that sorted out.",2
The fact that you don't is a little bit telling.,2
But I'm not done.,2
"There's also Oklahoma school superintendent Ryan Walters who banned LGBTQ material from schools on grounds that they were tantamount to porn, only to get caught screening pictures of naked women himself.",2
"Now before that, a local publication found old photos of him and his old friend where they were wearing matching flip flops and sitting conspicuously close to each other and the hand on the leg really says it all.",2
"But if that wasn't gay enough, he was also a big swifty apparently.",2
And the only thing that could possibly make that photo of him look gayer was if he had a dick in his mouth literally.,1
"Although to be fair to him, he presumably is a four on the Kinsey scale, which makes him bisexual, assuming that the straight porn that he had on his computer wasn't some form of exposure therapy that he was forcing himself to consume in order to become straight.",1
"Listen, I've been there Ryan. Spoiler alert, women are not an acquired taste, my friend.",2
You are not going to make yourself like it by watching it.,2
"But keep in mind, like these are only the more recent examples of high profile bigots getting exposed as closeted homosexuals or chasers.",1
"If I named all of them, we would be here all fucking day.",1
"In fact, the website gay homophob which kept track of them up until 2021 just stopped doing that because at this point, why even bother?",2
We all know that if somebody is vocally anti-gay or anti-trans it's probably because they have something to hide about themselves.,2
And this keeps fucking happening.,1
"Just last week, Bill Berrien and anti-trans Republican running for governor in Wisconsin got caught following multiple kink related accounts on medium, one of which was a trans porn star named Wait for it, Jizz Lee.",2
I take it because they're the jet leave jizzing.,2
"I mean, I don't know, but you can't make this shit up.",1
But they refuse to understand that their obsession with hating LGBTQ plus people makes them look more suspicious.,2
But what makes it all the more hilarious is when these idiots end up telling on themselves inadvertently.,1
"I'm of course talking about one of the biggest right-wing influencers right now in the game, Benny Johnson, whose initials are BJ, who notoriously outed himself literally while he was being anti-gay.",2
"I know you saw this, but in a now deleted tweet, he complained about the advertising on the military times website.",2
"And as you can see, there is indeed an ad for the world's largest gay cruise.",2
"But if you look at the little icons on the top right, you can see that these are Google ads based exclusively on his own search history.",2
"I'll never not be funny, but this man has a wife and kids.",2
"So like I couldn't imagine the look on his wife's face when she sees this and finds out, oh my god, I'm this man's beard.",2
What the fuck?,1
Although odds are she probably already had a hunch that this was indeed the case based on what fellow right-wingers have alleged.,2
"Back in March, so-called X-Gay, my Loganopolis tweeted, which happy-go-lucky podcast host gets trashed and has sex with young boys in the latter's hotel rooms at Turning Point conferences, leaving his wife weeping in the arms of other men downstairs amid the A-Pack leaflets and trussle tables.",2
"He falls up by saying his initials are BJ, and that's how a thousand twenty-year-old male turning point volunteers will remember him.",2
"Now a thousand might be a bit hyperbolic, althoughâ€¦",2
"On second thought, maybe he's making a more conservative estimate of what he says a thousand.",2
"But even though Milo Unopolis isn't the most reliable source, someone who is reliable corroborated that this is conduct from Benny Johnson at large gatherings, where there are other men who like other men, specifically back in his Buzzfeed days.",2
"So Said Jones explained on Blue Sky, I made out with Benny Johnson at an empty dressing room at a Buzzfeed holiday party in 2013.",2
It haunts me to this day.,2
"Anyway, it's funny that he's done literally everything but come out of the closet.",2
Then we'll literally become traders to their country rather than go to therapy.,2
"He goes on to explain, everyone got sloshed because of the open bar, Benny and I went into a dressing room and started kissing.",2
"Would have gone further, but he said something cringe enough to snap me back to my senses.",2
I rolled my eyes and left.,2
"Okay, this is like a hundred percent confirmation that this happened because that does sound like Benny Johnson.",2
"He adds, I'm not naming names, but I was just informed.",2
I wasn't even the only guy Benny made out with that night.,2
"So Benny Johnson's former Buzzfeed co-worker spills the tea and then his other co-workers reach out to that co-worker and say, yeah, you're not the only one.",2
"But look, I am so, so incredibly sorry that you had to visualize Benny Johnson making out with other men.",2
It almost makes me feel homophobic if I'm being honest.,1
"But I mean, I'm still glad that Said shared that information.",2
"But if I were in his shoes, that information would have gone with me to my fucking grave.",1
"Having said that, I am thankful that he spilled the tea as painful as it was because we have to expose these hypocritical pieces of shit.",1
But it's just so annoying that we even have to do this.,2
It's absurd to me that so many right-wingers are making their repressed sexual desires the entire country's problem.,1
They could be using the power that their side has to push for a piece or healthcare.,2
"But instead, what are they doing? They're doubling down on anti-aquar policies in hopes that I guess Republicans will band them from doing something that they can't stop doing on their own volition.",2
I guess they want big daddy government to save them from themselves.,2
"Perhaps they fear that if they would actually face penalties like jail time for homosexuality, then that would convince them to stop doing it.",1
"But that's not going to do the trick, whether they admit that or not, because they're not going to stop fucking men.",1
"Because even though they know they could be exposed as hypocrites, they're still doing it.",2
And some of them aren't even really trying to hide it that much.,2
"And even if like they went back to a pre-Lorense fee, Texas status quo in the United States where homosexuality was illegal, that's just going to make it all the more enticing to them.",1
They think it's hot because they love sexualizing people that they view as inferior.,1
"But if they really wanted to throw people off of their scent, they should probably stop talking about how much they hate queer people because it's not convincing anyone at this point, certainly not themselves.",2
They've apparently never heard the phrase doth protest too much because these motherfuckers never stop protesting.,1
They never shut the fuck up.,1
But you know who does shut the fuck up? Lensagram.,1
"Everybody knows Lensagram is gay, but nobody really talks about him being gay because he doesn't go out of his way to bash gay and trans people in every second.",2
"Look at his face. This is not the face of a heterosexual man, but he's at least self-aware to know that the loudest homophilms are always the biggest closet cases.",1
So what does he do? He just goes on about his life.,2
"He inconspicuously lets men fuck him while he finds ways to fuck all of us, politically speaking.",1
But most of these right-wing closet cases are just not going to stop bashing gay people regardless of how sus it makes them look.,2
So I think that what we need to do is weaponize their own homophobia against them and try to use it as a sort of deterrent to the extent that we can.,2
Let them know the next time they spew this bullshit that their hatred and bigotry makes them look really gay.,1
And that actual stray people don't spend most of their time thinking about how much they hate gay and trans people.,2
"Hell, gay and trans people don't think about gay and trans people as much as right-wingers think about gay and trans people.",2
So let them know that their bigotry looks like a self-report because it probably is.,2
"That might not persuade them to stop bashing queer people, but maybe it'll at least get them to think twice before they spew hate again or at the bare minimum.",2
Make them feel a little bit more shame the next time that they privately get barebacked by someone that they publicly claim to be disgusted by.,1
