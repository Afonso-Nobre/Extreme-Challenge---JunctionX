"Well, good afternoon. During one of my first press conferences as president, I pledged that fighting drug abuse would be a major goal of our administration.",2
Nancy had already made her major role.,2
I'm proud of the enormous effort that's been made in these last five and a half years to follow through on that pledge.,2
We've waged a good fight. The military forces have dramatically reduced drug use by 67 percent.,2
"We've been on the offensive attacking the peddlers, the transporters, the smugglers, the growers, everyone who's a part of the international network that channels drugs into America's neighborhoods and communities.",2
I asked arrest or up. Confiscations are up. Cooperation with other nations has increased.,2
So much has been accomplished and I'm encouraged that so many others from every walk of life are now joining the struggle.,2
"And yet drug use continues and its consequences escalate, claiming so many victims, including promising young athletes and bringing sorrow and heartbreak into homes across our country.",2
Drug use threatens the health and safety of millions of Americans.,2
"It extracts a high cost, the cost of crime stemming from drugs, the cost of drug related to health problems, the cost in productivity, the cost in the quality of American manufactured goods as we compete on the world market.",2
"But most of all, the cost in lives.",2
Drugs in one way or the other are victimizing all of us.,2
And that's why I'm here today to announce six major goals of what we hope will be the final stage in our national strategy to eradicate drug abuse.,2
I should point out that each of these goals includes a number of federal policy options that I will mention as we go along.,2
"But as you know, I've always insisted that such steps be the subject of a full discussion and debate within the administration before any final decisions are made.",2
So I will talk today of goals and a number of specific steps and we'll have further announcements in the very near future.,2
"But I want you to know that our announcements will not deal or will deal not just with what government will do, but what all of us will do and must do.",2
"For the key to our anti-drug strategy, my very reason for being here this afternoon is not to announce another short-term government offensive, but to call instead for a national crusade against drugs.",2
A sustained relentless effort to rid America of this scourge by mobilizing every segment of our society against drug abuse.,2
"But as I say, the solution does not lie simply within the realm of government, federal or state.",2
It's time to go beyond government.,2
All the confiscation and law enforcement in the world will not cure this plague as long as it is kept alive by public acquiescence.,2
"So we must now go beyond efforts aimed only at affecting the supply of drugs. We must affect not only supply, but demand.",2
I believe we've come to a time when the American people are willing to make it clear that illegal drug and alcohol use will no longer be tolerated.,2
A time when we will take those steps necessary to rid America of this deeply disruptive and corrosive evil.,2
"So starting today, Nancy's crusade to deprive the drug peddlers and suppliers of their customers becomes America's crusade.",2
We mean to reach out to the drug user and we mean to prevent others from becoming users.,2
"Our goal is not to throw users in jail, but to free them from drugs.",2
"We will offer a helping hand, but we will also pressure the user at school and in the workplace to straighten up to get clean.",2
We will refuse to let drug users blame their behavior on others. We will insist they take responsibility for their own actions.,2
"And finally, yet first and foremost, we will get the message to the potential user that drug use will no longer be tolerated that they must learn to just say no.",2
"Nancy spoke those words in Oakland, California just a few years ago.",2
"And today, there are now more than 10,000 just say no clubs among our young people all across America.",2
"If this battle is to be won and it must, each and every one of us has to take a stand and get involved.",2
"Leadership and commitment must be evident not only in the White House and the State House, but also in the pulpit at the workplace, in the Union Hall, in our schools and in the media.",2
"If we're to defeat this enemy, we've got to do it as one people together, united in purpose and committed a victory.",2
And victory in this case is a drug-free generation.,2
